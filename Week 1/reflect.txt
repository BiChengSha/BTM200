By completing this workshop, I have learned the basics of working with SSH and SCP/SFTP on Windows. I also discovered that Windows 10 also now has built in support for these commands directly into command promt without the need to install PuTTY and WinSCP. 
Upon completion of this lab, I found that many of my peers were having issues with their connection to Matrix, which turned out to simply be a URL mismatch rather than some fatal error. As I had previously taken LNX155, I already had access to Matrix and therefore previous experience to connecting to Matrix via SSH.
